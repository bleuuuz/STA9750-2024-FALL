<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>
<p>In a world inundated with cinematic mediocrity, we’ve become accustomed to the dreaded sequel. A once-promising franchise, often reduced to a shadow of its former self, plagued by plot holes, uninspired performances, and a seemingly endless pursuit of box office dollars. This is a tragedy that has befallen my favorite franchise, the Star Wars Universe.</p>
<p>What was once a beautifully constructed story was turned upside down in the hands of Disney when they released the sub-par Force Awakens trilogy. Although it has been nine years since then, it still haunts me every May 4th.</p>
<p>To help myself cope with my Star Wars-induced depression, I wanted to create a model to measure the success of the franchise’s old films compared to some of the long-time greats and see if they deserved a spot in the hall of fame.</p>

<p>For our ultimate metric, we have to look through history to see what movies and shows performed the best. To do this, I used the following code to pull a smaller subsection of data from IMDB (so that my computer won’t melt down) with the following code.</p>

<p>Hm… Although we’ve already selected a filtered subset of IMDB data, our NAME_BASICS data set still seems too large and is slowing our program down. To fix this, we can whittle it down even further by removing people who are known for less than two productions in our NAME_BASICS dataset.</p>

<p>According to our visualization, it seems like ratings plummeted throughout the next two seasons after the “Jump the shark” episode but recovered from seasons 8-11. Despite recovering in later seasons, the earlier seasons of the show on average have higher ratings.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-a-success-metric">Creating a Success Metric:</h3>
<p>As I looked through the IMBD data sets, it made sense that the TITLE_RATINGS data set would contain the best measurable variables like average rating and number of votes.</p>
<p>Based upon this, I decided to create the following success metric:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success Metric = (Average rating * log(Number of Votes))</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This metric is a weighted score that gives more weight to movies with both high ratings and a large number of votes while also reducing the heavy right skew of our data set using a logorithmic function.</p>
<p><strong>Testing the Metric</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1: Choose the top 5-10 movies on your metric and confirm that they were indeed box office successes.</strong></p>

<p>Using Mark Hamill’s data that we already prepped before, we can join it with our movie success data set to see that his four movies all rank rather high on our metric. (As they should being great Starwars movies!)</p>
<p><strong>3.4: Perform at least one other form of ‘spot check’ validation.</strong></p>
<p>What better way to do a spot-check validation than to use our metric against one of the biggest sequel flops of all time, Grease 2.</p>

<p>Since Grease 2 was determined to be a flop by many standards with a success score of 21.13, using a 95% threshold at 29.82 would be reasonable to consider a project to be a success.</p>

<p><strong>4.2: What genre consistently has the most “successes”? What genre used to reliably produce “successes” and has fallen out of favor?</strong></p>
<p>According to our chart, we can see that the Drama category has consistently outperformed the rest of the genres over the decades while romance seems to have fallen out for favor going from 5th place in the 2000’s to nearly last in the 2020’s.</p>
<p><strong>4.3: What genre has produced the most “successes” since 2010? Does it have the highest success <em>rate</em> or does it only have a large number of successes because there are many productions in that genre?</strong></p>
<p>Drama has produced the most successes since 2010 and it does seem to have a large number of successes due to production size rather than a higher success rate. In fact, dramas only have a 6% success rate compared to less popular biographies with a whopping 13%!</p>

<p>Based on my analysis of our movie data for the top biography actors, I’ve decided to select Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey as my actors. Their ability to portray complex, morally ambiguous characters like Patrick Bateman and Mark Hanna demonstrates their suitability for a darker, more twisted biography. Given their history of success in the genre and their ability to convey nuanced emotions, I believe that they would be invaluable assets to a biographical film exploring morally complex figures in a war setting. Along with that, both of these actors fall within the top nine most successful biographical movies as well as the top four in average success score.</p>

<p>In terms of a director, there is no other clear choice to me than Steven Speilberg. Despite falling lower on the list in terms of successful biographical movies, Spielberg represents the cream of the crop in terms of average success score. Steven Spielberg’s masterful storytelling and ability to draw exceptional performances from actors would undoubtedly complement the strengths of Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale. Spielberg’s visionary direction and keen eye for detail in works like saving Private Ryan would provide a rich, dark, and immersive world for both these talented actors to inhabit. His ability to elicit powerful emotional performances would allow McConaughey and Bale to fully explore the complexities of their characters, bringing their unique talents to the forefront.</p>

<p>The movie I want to remake it Schindler’s List from 1993. This movie is a historical drama film that tells the true story of Oskar Schindler,a German businessman who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews during the Holocost. Schindlers List has a whopping 9 rating on IMDB with over 1.4mm votes giving a high success score of 55.52 based on our metric. Along with that, this movie was produced over 25 years ago and having Steven Spielberg on board would make it easy to obtain the rights to reproduce it. (As he was the original director of the movie) On the other hand, our legal team would have to reach out to the former key actors like Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes regarding rights to the project.</p>

<p><strong>Dramas have reigned supreme in the film industry for decades and has consistently been the best performing genre for the last 100 years.</strong> With over 3400 titles created between 1990 onwards it is no surprise just how effective these movies are at evoking powerful emotions and creating heartfelt stories.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Spielberg, a visionary director with a proven track record of success,</strong> has a knack for crafting thought-provoking dramas that make people wrap heads around difficult to solve moral dilemmas. His collaboration with <strong>Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale</strong>, two of Hollywood’s most acclaimed actors known for playing morally ambiguous roles, would create a powerful and unforgettable cinematic experience.</p>
<p><strong>Schindler’s List</strong>, a timeless tale of courage, compassion, and the human spirit, is ripe for a modern reimagining. With Spielberg’s masterful direction and the exceptional talents of McConaughey and Bale, this film promises to be a powerful exploration of relevant themes.</p>
<p><strong>This new adaptation will captivate audiences with its compelling narrative, unforgettable performances, and stunning visuals.</strong> It’s a must-see film that will leave a lasting impression.</p>
