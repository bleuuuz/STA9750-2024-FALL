<p>From the bustling streets of New York City to the serene landscapes of the Pacific Northwest, America’s public transit systems offer a diverse range of options to get you where you need to go… eventually.</p>
<p>If the American transit systems were to have a commercial brochure it would look a little like the following:</p>
<p><strong>Experience the convenience and efficiency of American Public Transit with…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Subways:</strong> Navigate the heart of major cities with ease and speed… or watch as the train you were running to catch closes its doors in front of your eyes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buses:</strong> Explore neighborhoods and connect to popular destinations… as long as they haven’t been rerouted due to unexpected construction or traffic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trains:</strong> Enjoy scenic journeys and efficient transportation between cities… unless there’s a mechanical issue or a signal malfucntion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Light rail:</strong> Experience modern, eco-friendly travel in urban areas… just be prepared to wait half an hour for the next one to arrive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Streetcars:</strong> Discover historic charm and convenient transportation options… or experience the occasional track fire.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although the US transit systems are prone to issues as highlighted in the free brochure, they also serve as a ‘reliable’, accessible, and affordable means of transportation. (Unless you live in NYC where they just hiked fares to $2.90)</p>
<p>As I learned more about this topic, I began to realize just how far-reaching the US transit system was. I mean, did you know that within the United States, there are 678 different transit systems? I would’ve never guessed.</p>
<p>Delving deeper into this <strong>train of thought</strong>, I pulled together data from 3 different sources on the National Transit Database and cranked out quite a few interesting insights on United States Transit systems.</p>
<p>1) The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue</a> table</p>
<p>2) The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports</p>
<p>3) The latest <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> tables</p>

<p><strong>1) MTA New York City Transit is the most traveled US transit system in terms of Vehicle Revenue Miles.</strong></p>
<p>As a New Yorker, I’m convinced that New York City is the best city in the world. This statement however isn’t only supported by <strong>our top ranking in rats per household</strong> but also manifests itself in the number of people that take <strong>public transportation</strong>.</p>
<p>After analyzing data for 678 different public transit agencies in the United States, and summing their vehicle revenue miles, we find that the NYC MTA takes the lead with 10.8B traveled miles. To put that into perspective, that’s the equivalent of three one-way trips to Pluto.</p>

<p>If that stat didn’t sell you on the MTA’s public transit dominance, if we look at the next two most utilized public transportation systems in the US, they don’t even come close in terms of miles traveled. (NJT coming in at 5.6B and LACTA coming in at 4.3B)</p>
<p>To be fair, these numbers make sense if we take a look at how many trips were taken on the NYC Subway (Heavy rail) in May of 2024 by itself. By filtering our data for NYC MTA, Heavy Rail, and 2024-05-01, we can see the following number of trips taken…</p>

<p>Extrapolating and coverting this to a yearly amount result in ~2,165,505,828 trips which is a heck of a lot. In fact, this number doesn’t even account for the impact COVID-19 had on subway ridership.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 and its Impact on NYC MTA Ridership</strong></p>
<p>To analyze the impact that COVID-19 had on the MTA, we can compare NYC MTA unlinked passenger trips pre-pandemic and MTA unlinked passenger trips during the pandemic. For this example, I pulled data for the NYC MTA heavy rail for April 2019 and April 2020 and this is how it came out.</p>

<p>As you can see, MTA Transit ridership has steadily grown from 2002-2019 until the pandemic took place. Since then, MTA ridership has not fully recovered. If we were to take this into account and use pre-pandemic numbers as an estimate of yearly ridership, we could have seen ridership volumes of up to <strong>2.75B!</strong></p>
<p>Although I could talk about New York City all day, I’m sure you’d find it more interesting if I threw some other discoveries at you.</p>
<p><strong>2) The United States Loves Buses</strong></p>
<p>With all the talk about heavy rails and subways, you would figure that they’d be the most popular form of public transportation in the United States… Well, you guessed wrong.</p>
<p>After pulling ridership data, grouping it by transportation mode, and summing the total vehicle miles… <strong>Buses came out on top with 49,444,494,088 total miles traveled!</strong> (Approximately 13.75 Pluto trips!)</p>

<p>Well, what do you know! The <strong>NJT Corporation lead with a staggering total of 3,781,858,802</strong> vehicle revenue miles while the Windham Region Transit dragged down the average with a measly 21,265.</p>
<p><strong>3) The Award for least used Public Transportation goes to the Municipality of Carolina Demand Response</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately for the Winham transit, the Municipality of Carolina demand response takes the award for the least used public transportation. Contrary to its name, this transit system does not serve communities in North Carolina or South Carolina but instead operates within the municipality of Carolina, Puerto Rico. After pulling and sorting the data for the municipality in R, I found that this transit system served a total whopping 225 unlinked passenger trips!</p>

<p><strong>4) The United States Public Transportation System faces a Significant Funding Gap.</strong></p>
<p>While the United States public transit systems provide a vital service for millions of commuters, operating costs often exceed revenues. Farebox revenue, typically the largest source of income for transit systems, often falls short of covering expenses which leads to unprofitable modes of public transportation.</p>
<p>For example, the New York City MTA had the most unlinked passenger trips at an astounding 1,793,073,801 in 2022 but it’s farebox recovery ratio was rather lackluster 0.325. This means that the NYC MTA is an extremely unprofitable transit system and for every dollar the NYC MTA spends, it only brings in $0.325 of revenue.</p>

<p>As a result of low farebox revenues, transit agencies rely heavily on government subsidies, including federal, state, and local funds. While these subsidies are essential for maintaining operations, it is interesting to take a look at which transit systems are the best self-sustaining and most efficient with their resources. This, however, is not an easy task as there are <strong>many metrics to measure efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The most profitable transit system in terms of profits/expenses</strong> is the Port Imperial Ferry Corporation which serves the NY/NJ region with a farebox recovery ratio of 1.423.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: Port Imperial is the most efficient in terms of profitability and the NYC MTA is the most efficient in terms of sheer transportation</strong></p>
<p>While efficiency is hard to measure with one metric, by far the <strong>Port Imperial Ferry Corporation</strong> blows the competition <strong>out of the water</strong> in terms of pure profitability. The agency is so profitable that it has been able to fund itself without government subsidies while serving 7m+ unlinked trips annually.</p>
<p>Despite Port Imperial leading the group in profitability, it serves a much smaller range of constituents than its next-door neighbor,the MTA. The NYC MTA has the capability to help commuters make over 1.8B trips annually with the capacity to grow even more. In terms of sheer transportation, it is impossible to beat and deserves a spot as one of the most efficient transit systems due the scale that is has been able to obtain.</p>
